                <p class="bio" id="childhood-and-education">Mustafa Kemal was born in 1881 in Salonika (Selanik). His
                    fathers name
                    was Ali Rıza Efendi. His father was customs official. His mothers name was Zübeyde Hanım. For his
                    primary education, he went to the school of Şemsi Efendi in Salonika. But Mustafa lost his father at
                    an early age. He had to leave school. Mustafa and his mother went to live with his uncle in the
                    country. His mother brought him up. Life continu ed like this for a time. Mustafa worked on the farm
                    but his mother began to worry about his lack of schooling. It was finally decided that he should
                    live with his mothers sister in Salonika.

                <h2 class="paragraph-title">Mustafa Kemal as an Army Commander</h2>
                <p class="bio" id="army-commander">
                    In 1906, he was sent to Damascus (Şam). Mustafa Kemal and his friends founded a society which they
                    called "Vatan ve Hürriyet" (Fatherland and Freedom) in Damascus. On his own initiative, he went to
                    Tripoli during the war with Italy in 1911 and took part in the defence of Derne and Tobruk While he
                    was still in Libya, the Balkan War broke out. He served in the Balkan War as a successful Commander
                    (1912-1914). At the end of the Balkan War, Mustafa Kemal was appointed military attache in Sofia.
                    When Mustafa Kemal was in Sofia, the First World War broke out. Hewas made Commander of the
                    Anafartalar Group on 8th of August, 1915. In the First World War he was in command of the Turkish
                    forces at Anafartalar ata critical moment. This was when the Allied landings in the Dardanelles
                    (Çanakkale Boğazı) took place and he personally saved the situation. During the battle, Mustafa
                    Kemal was hit by shrapnel above the heart, but a watch in his breast pocket saved his life. Mustafa
                    Kemal explained his state of mind as he accepted this great responsibility: "Indeed, it was not easy
                    to shoulder such responsibility, but as I had decided not to live to see my countrys destruction, I
                    accepted it proudly." He then served in the Caucasus and in Syria and just before the armistice in
                    1918 he was placed in command of the Lightning Army group in Syria. After the armistice (peace
                    agreement), he returned to İstanbul.

                <h2 class="paragraph-title">The War of Independence</h2>
                <p class="bio" id="the-war-of-independence">
                    After the Armistice of Mondoros, the countries that had signed the agreement did not consider it
                    necessary to abide by its terms. Under various pretexts the navies and the armies of the Entente (
                    France, Britain and Italy ) were in İstanbul, while the p rovince of Adana had been occupied by the
                    French and Urfa and Maraş by the British. There were Italian soldiers in Antalya and Konya, and
                    British soldiers in Merzifon and Samsun. Everywhere there were foreign officers, officials and
                    agents. On the 15th of May 1919 the Greek Army landed in İzmir with the agreement of the Entente.
                    Under difficult conditions, Mustafa Kemal decided to go to Anatolia. On 16th of May 1919, he left
                    İstanbul in a small boat called the "Bandırma". Mustafa Kemal was warned that his enemies had
                    planned to sink his ship on the way out. But he was not afraid and on Monday19th May 1919, he
                    arrived in Samsun and set foot on Anatolian soil. That date marks the beginning of the Turkish War
                    of Independence . It is also the date Mustafa Kemal later chose as his own birthday. A wave of
                    national resistance arose in Anatolia. A movement had already begun in Erzurum in the east and
                    Mustafa Kemal quickly placed himself at the head of the whole organization. The congresses in
                    Erzurum and Sivas in the Summer of 1919 declared the nat ional aims by a national pact. When the
                    foreign armies occupied Istanbul, on 23th of April 1920 Mustafa Kemal opened the Turkish Grand
                    National Assembly and hence established a provisional new government, the centre of which was to be
                    Ankara. On the same day Mustafa Kemal was elected President of the Grand National Assembly. The
                    Greeks, profiting by the rebellion of Çerkez Ethem and acting in collaboration with him, started to
                    advance towards Bursa and Eskişehir. On the 10th of January 1921, the enemy forces were heavily
                    defeated by the Commander of the Western Front, Colon el İsmet and his troops. On the 10th of July
                    1921, the Greeks launched a frontal attack with five divisions on Sakarya. After the great battle of
                    Sakarya, which continued without interruption from the 23rd of August to the 13th of September, the
                    Greek Army was defeated and ha d to retreat. After the battle, the Grand National Assembly gave
                    Mustafa Kemal the titles of Ghazi and Marshal. Mustafa Kemal decided to drive the enemies out of his
                    country. He gave the order that the attack should be launched on the morning of the 26th of August
                    1922. The bulk of the enemy forces were surrounded and killed or captured on the 30th of August at D
                    umlupınar. The enemy Commander - in - Chief, General Trikupis, was captured. Or the 9th of September
                    1922 the fleeing enemy forces were driven into the sea near İzmir. The Turkish forces, under the
                    extraordinary military skill of Kemal Atatürk, fought a War of Independence against the occupying
                    Allied powers and in the end won victories on every front all over the country. On the 24th of July
                    1923, with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, (Lozan Antlaşması ) the independence of the new
                    Turkish State was recognised by all countries. Mustafa Kemal built up a new, sturdy, vigorous state.
                    On the 29th of October 1923, he d eclared the new Turkish state a Republic. Following the
                    declaration of the Republic, the Caliphate wase abolished. Mustafa Kemal was elected the first
                    President of the Republic of Turkey.

                <h2 class="paragraph-title">Atatürk's Death</h2>
                <p class="bio" id="death">
                    Atatürk made frequent tours of the country. While visiting Gemlik and Bursa, Atatürk caught a chill.
                    He returned to Istanbul to be treated and to rest. But, unfortunately Atatürk was seriously ill. At.
                    9.05 on the 10th of November 1938, Atatürk died. But he attained immortality in the eyes of his
                    people. Since the moment of his death, his beloved name and memory have been engraved on the hearts
                    of his people. As a commander he had been the victor of many battles, as a leader he had influenced
                    the masses, as a statesman he had led a successful administration, and as a revolutionary he had
                    striven to alter the social, cultural, economic, political and legal str ucture of society at its
                    roots. He was one of the most eminent personalities in the history of the world. History will count
                    him among the most glorious sons of the Turkish nation and one of the great leaders of mankind.
